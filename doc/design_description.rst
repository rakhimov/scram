    Complex Dependency Diagram (TheDailyWTF)

Core
====

#. XML Parser leverages external libraries to process XML files.

#. Validator validates XML configuration and input files against the RELAX NG schema.
   The validation against the schema is an integral part of the initialization.
   Values that pass the validation against the schema are not re-checked by users of those values.

#. Settings manages overall analysis settings per run.
#. Config manages program configurations and analysis settings from a configuration file.
#. Containers: models, fault trees, event trees, components.

#. Analysis constructs: anything that is stored in containers and can be an input for analysis.
   Note that some containers are constructs as well.

    * Formula, Expressions, and other facilities used by the analysis constructs.

#. Initializer processes input files to construct a model
   with fault trees, event trees, CCF, and other analysis containers and constructs.
   This initialization phase validates the values and logic supplied from the input files.
   The constructs and analyses are initialized according to the configurations
   supplied from the configuration file and command-line.
   After the initialization step,
   it is not expected that constructs of the analysis change.

#. Risk Analyzer operates on a valid model
   with initialized fault, event trees, and other constructs
   to provide the requested results.
   It runs after the initialization phase with the user-specified analysis settings.

#. Analyzers of fault trees, event trees, CCF, uncertainty,
   and other analysis kinds.
   These analyzers are employed by the main Risk Analyzer
   to produce final results.
   Common facilities, utilities, and functionalities
   can be shared among these analyzers.
   Analyzers and analysis facilities are designed
   in the spirit of `Design by Contract`_ and `Policy-based design`_
   to keep the code simple and flexible with algorithms.

    1. Fault Tree Analyzer operates on one fault tree with a single top event,
       and may provide primary events, intermediate events,
       and  products (minimal cut sets or prime implicants) as output,
       or other information about the passed fault tree.
       This fault tree analyzer uses many other helper facilities
       specifically designed to make the analysis efficient and fast.

    2. Probability Calculator accepts the results of Fault Tree Analyzer
       to calculate the total probability
       and to provide facilities for other Quantitative analyzers.

    3. Importance Analyzer calculates
       importance factors of *important* basic events
       with Probability Calculator facilities.

    4. Uncertainty Analyzer uses Probability Calculator facilities
       to sample basic event probabilities
       and calculate the total probability.
       Sampled results are processed to find statistical information,
       such as mean, confidence ranges, standard deviation, and distributions.

#. Reporter outputs the results of the work of Risk Analyzer
   to specified files or streams in XML format.

#. Support components:
   Logger, XML stream, and library extensions in the ext namespace.
