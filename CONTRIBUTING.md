## Developer Workflow

1. Start by forking this repository and setting it as the upstream repository.
2. Create your **topic** branch from the **develop** branch.
3. Keep in sync your **origin** develop branch with the **upstream** develop branch.
4. Develop your contributions following the [Coding Style and Quality Assurance].
   Every commit should compile and pass tests.
5. Keep your **topic** branch in sync with the **develop** branch
   by merging or rebasing your **topic** branch on top of the **develop**.
   Rebasing is highly recommended for streamlining the history.
   However, **DO NOT** rebase any commits
   that have been pulled/pushed anywhere else other than your own fork.
6. Use the [developer mailing list] and [Issue Tracker]
   to stay in touch with the project development.
7. Submit your [pull request] from **your topic** branch to the **upstream develop** branch.
8. Your pull request will be reviewed by another developer before merging.
